                                    Student Branches are pivotal in the growth and maintenance of IEEE student members.
                                    Each year, they put in extraordinary effort for the benefit of the ever-growing
                                    student community. To recognize their outstanding efforts, IEEE has instituted four
                                    Student Awards: Larry K. Wilson Regional Student Activities Award, IEEE Regional
                                    Exemplary Student Branch Award, The Darrel Chong Student Activity Award and IEEE
                                    Outstanding Branch Counselor and Branch Chapter Advisor Award.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Last year saw a remarkable amount of quality activities and initiatives being
                                    conducted by the Student Branches of IEEE Kerala Section, with nine of them
                                    receiving the Regional Exemplary Student Branch Award. One good thing about this
                                    award is that there is no numerical limit imposed on the number of awardees – all
                                    applicants who meet a certain set of criteria will be awarded.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The award aims to provide public recognition of exemplary IEEE Student Branch
                                    operations. To qualify for this award, a student branch must conform to IEEE bylaws,
                                    have an active program, and support IEEE goals. Only the activities, initiatives and
                                    accomplishments of the previous calendar year (i.e., from January 1 to December 31
                                    of the preceding year) will be considered for evaluation.

                                    It is advised to inform the endorsement nominee beforehand before nominating them; make sure they are aware of the steps they need to follow, and provide them with a draft of the endorsement content if possible, as it will ease the endorsement process for the nominee.

                                    An advice to the SBs: apply this year, and plan activities of the coming year accordingly to apply better next year. By the words of Mr Govindaraman S, Chair of IEEE MACE SB 2021, “All awards are a recognition of our past activities, and will motivate us to do better ones in the future.” Ms Haritha M E, Chair of IEEE GCEK SB 2021, adds,”Receiving an award at present will boost our applications for other awards in the future.” Both SBs are recipients of the IEEE Regional Exemplary Student Branch Award 2021.
                                </p>
